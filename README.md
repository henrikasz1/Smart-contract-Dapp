# Smart-contract-Dapp

:hash: It is a simple decentralized e-shop application :hash:

**Aspects to be included in program:**
* Make a smart contract using Solidity programming language
* Test smart contract using local and Ethereum test networks
* Check execution logs in Etherscan
* Make a front-end for application (website, app, etc.)

**How the program was made:**

At first, I had to make a smart contract using Solidity programming language. Then I initialized a new truffle project, put a smart contract inside of it and wrote some tests in order to check if the contract works as it should.
